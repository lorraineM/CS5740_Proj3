# QA System
It's a project for Natural Language Processing (CS 5740)

Goal: We are required to apply NLP knowledge to implement a QA system that will work on a real world challenge task: SQuAD. No human intervention is allowed in deriving answers.
Input: a passage with a set of questions.
Output: for each question, output a segment of text from the passage that answers it.

Implement: we tried two different approaches for the QA system
  * Project3_Shuo.ipynb [logistic regression] 
  * xyproject3.py [unigram model]
